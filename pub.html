<p>The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to investigate associations between depression and anxiety disorder and the risk of COVID-19 severity and mortality in patients treated in large hospitals in Germany. This retrospective study was based on anonymized electronic medical data from 50 public healthcare service hospitals across Germany. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to study associations between depression, anxiety and mechanical ventilation and mortality due to COVID adjusted for age, sex, time of COVID-19 diagnosis, and pre-defined co-diagnoses. Of 28,311 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 1970 (6.9%) had a diagnosis of depression and 369 (1.3%) had a diagnosis of anxiety disorder prior to contracting COVID-19. While multivariable logistic regression models did not indicate any association between depression diagnosis and the risk of mechanical ventilation, depression was associated with a decreased risk of mortality (OR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.53-0.94). There was no association between anxiety disorders and risk of mortality, but there was a strong positive association between anxiety disorders and the risk of mechanical ventilation (OR: 2.04; 95% CI: 1.35-3.10). In the present study, depression and anxiety disorder diagnoses were not associated with increased COVID-19 mortality. Anxiety disorder was strongly associated with an increased risk of mechanical ventilation. Further studies are needed to clarify how depression and anxiety disorders may influence COVID-19 severity and mortality.</p>

<p>SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with cancer have a worse outcome including a significant higher mortality, compared to non-cancer patients. However, limited data are available regarding in-hospital mortality during the Omicron phase of the pandemic. Therefore, the aim of the study was the comparison of mortality in patients with history of cancer and patients with active cancer disease during the different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on the current Omicron variant of concern. We conducted a multicenter, observational, epidemiological cohort study at 45 hospitals in Germany. Until July 20, 2022, all adult hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were included. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality regarding cancer status (history of cancer and active cancer disease) and SARS-CoV-2 virus type. From March 11 2020 to July 20 2022, a total of 27,490 adult SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were included into the study. 2,578 patients (9.4%) had diagnosis of cancer, of whom 1,065 (41.3%) had history of cancer, whereas 1,513 (58.7%) had active cancer disease. Overall 3,749 out of the total of 27,490 patients (13.6%) died during the hospital stay. Patients with active cancer disease had a significantly higher mortality compared to patients without cancer diagnosis, in both phases of the pandemic (wild-type to Delta: OR 1.940 [1.646-2.285]); Omicron: 2.864 [2.354-3.486]). After adjustment to co-variables, SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with active cancer disease had the highest risk for in-hospital mortality compared to the other groups, in both phases of the pandemic. The CORONA Germany study indicates that hospitalized patients with active cancer disease are at high risk of death during a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mortality of patients with history of cancer improved to nearly the level of non-cancer patients during Omicron phase.</p>

<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the attitudes toward eating disorders in native German adolescents (Germans), adolescents with Turkish migration background in Germany (Immigrants), and native Turkish adolescents (Turks). A total of 507 adolescents (N = 139 Germans; N = 126 Immigrants; N = 242 Turks) read a vignette describing a 16-year-old female with bulimic symptoms. Participants completed questionnaires on mental health literacy, stigmatization, desirability of eating disorder-related behaviors and acquaintance with bulimic symptoms. Adolescents living in Germany were more likely to recognize the vignette as an eating disorder than Turks. Immigrants were more similar to Germans in mental health literacy of eating disorders than Turks. However, in terms of stigmatizing attitudes, immigrants blamed more than Germans, Turks being intermediate on this variable. In Turks, higher desirability of eating disorder-related behaviors was associated with an increased acquaintance with bulimic symptoms and decreased evaluations of impairment. Higher mental health literacy was associated with less blame in Germans. Migration background was associated with increased mental health literacy of eating disorders but did not result in reduced stigma. Differences in attitudes toward eating disorders indicate the need for differential interventions across the groups.</p>

<p>Eating disorder mental health literacy (ED-MHL) refers to knowledge about the symptoms, causes, and treatment of eating disorders (EDs) and is an important factor in people’s attitudes towards individuals with EDs and help-seeking for EDs. Associations between ED-MHL, stigma, ED symptomatology, and gender were investigated in a sample of N = 194 German high school students. Knowledge and myths about EDs were assessed with 18 factual statements about EDs and agreement/disagreement with common myths about ED. Students also completed the Universal Stigma Scale (USS), the Weight Concerns Scale (WCS), and demographic items. Students judged M = 8.39 (SD = 3.40) statements correctly, while the average agreement with all ED myths was low (M = 0.19, SD = 0.14). Greater ED-MHL was associated with lower stigmatization of EDs. Male participants were less knowledgeable and more likely to agree with the ED myths. Participants displayed moderate ED-MHL; however, certain aspects such as ED risk factors or symptoms of specific disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa were less well known. These results can inform the design of future MHL interventions for adolescents.</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, increases in suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in adolescents have been registered. Many adolescents experiencing suicidal ideation turn to online communities for social support. In this retrospective observational study, we investigated the communication-language style, contents and user activity-in 7975 unique posts and 51,119 comments by N = 2862 active adolescent users in a large suicidal ideation support community (SISC) on the social media website reddit.com in the onset period of the COVID-19 pandemic. We found significant relative changes in language style markers for hopelessness such as negative emotion words (+ 10.00%) and positive emotion words (-&nbsp;3.45%) as well as for social disengagement such as social references (-&nbsp;8.63%) and 2nd person pronouns (-&nbsp;33.97%) since the outbreak of the pandemic. Using topic modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), we identified significant changes in content for the topics Hopelessness (+ 23.98%), Suicide Methods (+ 17.11%), Social Support (-&nbsp;14.91%), and Reaching Out to users (-&nbsp;28.97%). Changes in user activity point to an increased expression of mental health issues and decreased engagement with other users. The results indicate a potential shift in communication patterns with more adolescent users expressing their suicidal ideation rather than relating with or supporting other users during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>An increasingly important source of informal help for people with depression are online depression communities. This study investigates the prevailing topics in an online depression community and how they are related to participation styles. A topic model with 26 topics of N = 16,291 posts and N = 71,543 comments of N = 20,037 users in a depression forum on Reddit was created using Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). The topics’ proportions in the corpus were correlated with five participation measures, i.e.&nbsp;sum of scores, number of comments, posts to comments ratio, posting frequency, and word count. The most common topics were Feelings, Motivation, The Community on Reddit, and Time. There were many significant, small to moderate correlations between topic proportions and participation style measures. The topics Feelings, Offering Support, and Small Talk generated a bigger response in the form of scores and comments. Talking about the past and relationships was more common in longer posts, whereas small talk, offering emotional support, and employing cognitive strategies was more readily found in short comments. Lower posting frequency was related to talking about feelings and romantic relationships. No information on users’ demographics or mental health status was available. Topic modeling cannot capture elements of style and tone of text. A wide spectrum of topics was uncovered in the topic modeling. Patterns in the correlations point to users with different participation styles preferring different topics. Results of this study can aid the development of online interventions for depression.</p>

<p>The aim of this study was to investigate help-seeking attitudes, intentions, and behaviors, and to systematically explore perceived barriers to help-seeking for eating, weight, or shape concerns among young adults. Differences in perceived barriers as a function of type of eating disorder symptomatology were also examined. Data were collected using an online survey among individuals (aged 18-25 years) in Australia. Overall, 291 young adults with varying levels of eating disorder symptoms completed measures of disordered eating, weight or shape concerns, help-seeking barriers, attitudes, intentions, and behaviors. According to their self-reported symptoms, participants were classified into four subgroups (i.e., anorexia nervosa [AN] symptoms, bulimia nervosa [BN] symptoms, binge-eating disorder [BED] symptoms, and other eating disorder symptoms). Despite the belief that help-seeking is useful, only a minority of participants with elevated symptoms, namely those with AN, BN, and BED symptoms, believed they needed help. Across the sample, the most frequently cited barriers to seeking help for eating disorder symptoms were: concern for others, self-sufficiency, fear of losing control, denial and failure to perceive the severity of the illness, and stigma and shame. The findings highlight the need to educate young adults about the severity of eating disorders and the importance of seeking help, and to increase the awareness of help-seeking barriers among those designing public health interventions as well as clinicians. Our findings suggest that help-seeking barriers may differ depending on the type of eating disorder symptomology.</p>

<p>COVID-19 has affected individuals with lived experience of eating disorders (EDs), with many reporting higher psychological distress, higher prevalence of ED symptoms, and compensatory behaviors. The COVID-19 pandemic and the health and safety measures taken to contain its spread also disrupted routines and reduced access to familiar coping mechanisms, social support networks, and health care services. Social media and the ED communities on social media platforms have been an important source of support for individuals with EDs in the past. So far, it is unknown how discussions in online ED communities changed as offline support networks were disrupted and people spent more time at home in the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study is to identify changes in language content and style in an online ED community during the initial onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We extracted posts and their comments from the ED community on the social media website Reddit and concatenated them to comment threads. To analyze these threads, we applied top-down and bottom-up language analysis methods based on topic modeling with latent Dirichlet allocation and 13 indicators from the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count program, respectively. Threads were split into prepandemic (before March 11, 2020) and midpandemic (after March 11, 2020) groups. Standardized mean differences were calculated to estimate change between pre- and midpandemic threads. A total of 17,715 threads (n=8772, 49.5% prepandemic threads; n=8943, 50.5% midpandemic threads) were extracted from the ED community and analyzed. The final topic model contained 21 topics. CIs excluding zero were found for standardized mean differences of 15 topics and 9 Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count categories covering themes such as ED symptoms, mental health, treatment for EDs, cognitive processing, social life, and emotions. Although we observed a reduction in discussions about ED symptoms, an increase in mental heal</p>

<p>Online pro-eating disorder (pro-ED) communities are considered harmful because of their detrimental effects on their users’ body dissatisfaction, dieting, and help seeking. To date, it is unknown to which extent participation in pro-ED communities affects users’ body weight and desired weight loss. This study aims to investigate the changes in the current and desired body weight of users of a pro-ED community (r/proed) on the social media website Reddit over time. Data on 1170 users and the unsolicited weight information they shared with the pro-ED community were collected over a period of 15 months. Linear growth models were used to model changes in the users’ current and desired BMI over time. Both current and desired BMI decreased over time, with a predicted rate of 0.087 and 0.015 BMI points per week, respectively. Weight loss was moderated by the users’ activity level in the community, with more active users losing more weight. Users with a higher baseline BMI experienced greater weight loss, but even users with a very low baseline weight (BMI &lt;17 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) lost weight during their participation. In addition, users decreased their desired weight over time, with many pursuing extremely low, unrealistic weight goals. Changes in the desired weight were moderated by the baseline current BMI and baseline desired BMI. Users with higher desired weight and lower body weight at baseline decreased their desired weight more over time. This is the first study to demonstrate the detrimental effects of pro-ED communities in a longitudinal study based on a large data set of user-generated online data. The results extend the literature detailing the harmful effects of online pro-ED communities by showing users’ weight loss, decreases in desired weight, and that higher activity levels lead to greater weight loss. Users could be driven to pursue very low, unrealistic weight loss goals by images of very thin bodies presented in these communities.</p>

<p>Social media plays an important role in everyday life of young people. Numerous studies claim negative effects of social media and media in general on eating disorder risk factors. Despite the availability of big data, only few studies have exploited the possibilities so far in the field of eating disorders. Methods for data extraction, computerized content analysis, and network analysis will be introduced. Strategies and methods will be exemplified for an ad-hoc dataset of 4,247 posts and 34,118 comments by 3,029 users of the proed forum on Reddit. Text analysis with latent Dirichlet allocation identified nine topics related to social support and eating disorder specific content. Social network analysis describes the overall communication patterns, and could identify community structures and most influential users. A linear network autocorrelation model was applied to estimate associations in language among network neighbors. The supplement contains R code for data extraction and analyses. This paper provides an introduction to investigating social media data, and will hopefully stimulate big data social media research in eating disorders. When applied in real-time, the methods presented in this manuscript could contribute to improving the safety of ED-related online communication.</p>
